# rock-paper-scissors
Third project from odin project curriculum where i will demonstrate more of what i have learnt from JavaScript - variables, functions, conditionals and most importantly programmer like thinking with planning doing pseudocode and dividing problems into smaller problems so i can solve them easily
1. Write a function that returns computer choice
    use math.random function to select a number from 0 to 2 and store that number in variable called random number
    if random number = 0 then return rock else if random number = 1 paper else scissors
